**Question**: 'Computers and AI technology are increasingly being used froe online education. Can artificial intelligence enhance the learning experience? Is this a positive or negative development?'
**Essay**: 'In  modern times, with the development of computers and AI technology, people tend to adapt to teachers in the aspect of teaching. From my attitude, AI can develop the learning experience due to the numerous knowledge but this situation will lead to a negative effect on their future and dependence.

It must be recognized that computers play a vital role in online education. In school, students have more exercises which require them  to find  information on social networks. Not only that, more teamwork is also required by their teachers to help them develop cooperative skills and understand the knowledge profoundly so computers become very useful for them at this time.Take America as a prime example where students can bring their laptops or devices  related to technology to help them find the data easily. Therefore, more students in this country are really good at researching and understanding lessons after attending the class.

Another point worth be considered is that the boost of AI on academic learning can result in a doubtful impact on the future of students and dependence. It can be understood that thanks to computers, more knowledge can be searched by students which may contain the key to their exam so the result of this test just shows the product of processing findings   . Not only that, computers can make students become more and more dependent on them. Students just want to search on the website which contains the key, they do not want to think more about this test, and want to find the keys as soon as possible. Therefore, many people in spite of attending full   lessons,  do not have many memories of lessons.

Taking everything into consideration, computers take an essential role in  online education due to the multitudinous knowledge but it also causes  serious consequences on the quality of study and reliance.'

**Question**: "Having more money and less free time is better than earning less money and having more free time. Discuss both views and state your opinion."
**Essay**: "Recently, there are two claims of earning money and free time. Some people believe that having more money and less free time is better, while others think that having more free time and earning less money is more important than previously. In my opinion, I believe that earning more money and undoubtedly less time free is more necessary for modern people.

One of the arguments is that having more money and less free time is better. People who have more money can become more financially independent. Many individuals work so hard so that they can introduce more structure into their lives and do not need to rely on others. For instance, people with more financial independence can support themselves and their families which can reduce their life stress and increase their quality of life. This increased independence can facilitate access to better education, health insurance, and more personal development. As a result, striving to earn more money can have priority over having more free time.

Another argument is that earning less money and having more free time can be more beneficial for people. Firstly, individuals can seek more personal interests and happiness or fulfilment in their free time. People can learn more skills and improve their ability in many fields or pick up a new hobby in their spare time. Secondly, there is more time provided for people who can have better balance between life and work when they have more free time. For example, this freedom allows people to spend time with families and their loved ones and take care of their own physical and mental health. Therefore, having more free time is more valuable for life.

In conclusion, while having spare time with important people is crucial for one's happiness and fulfilment, I believe that earning more money is more important, which can provide financial security and strong support for others."

**Question**: "Directors of large organizations are much higher salary than ordinary employees do. Some people think it's necessary, but others are of the opinion that it's unfair. Discuss both views and give your opinion."
**Essay**: "These days, ordinary employers are paying less compared to their supervisors. While it's upright towards bosses, as they are the founders of the companies, it's unfair towards employees who accomplish most of the tasks.

On the one hand, directors have the right to earn much higher salaries than employers. They are the heads of the companies and founded the company from the beginning. They put all their effort into establishing and succeeding this company.Moreover, they have to have good human management skills and accomplish their heavy duties by decision-making power. For example, if they see the company as having the ability to resolve mutual conflicts and harmonize their teams, the workers cannot work with higher productivity. Thus, it's necessary for employers to have much higher salaries. 

On the other hand, it's kind of unfair towards workers who work for far more hours than employers. They accomplish more tasks and have an overload of schedules and duties. For instance, nurses and medical staff often work long hours, handle critical tasks, and deal with high levels of stress in hospitals. Despite their crucial role in patient care, their salaries are typically lower than those of hospital administrators or directors. Therefore, from one side, the salary gap is not fair for some workers.  Thus, low wage can have a negative impact on employee morale and motivation.

In conclusion, while acknowledging the foundational role of directors, fair compensation should reflect the significant contributions of all employees, aligning with their duties and responsibilities within the organization."
