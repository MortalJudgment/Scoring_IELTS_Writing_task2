{ "1" : { "band": 9,"answer":"It is often said that music has the power to unite and connect people, regardless of their cultural backgrounds or ages. I completely agree with this view, and will give my reasons below.\r\n\r\nMusic can certainly reach across cultural and national boundaries and bring people together. Perhaps the best example of this would be the Live Aid concerts that took place back in the 1980s, and which were broadcast to a global audience. Two live events were held simultaneously in the UK and the US, and the objective was to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. The concerts were a huge success, both in terms of the number of people around the world who watched them and their impact on international public awareness of the famine. They demonstrated, I believe, that music truly is the planet’s global language.\r\n\r\nJust as it transcends cultures, music also has the ability to connect people from different generations. Regardless of age, we can all enjoy a memorable melody, a strong rhythm or a beautiful singing voice, and the best songs seem to have the same magical effect on all of us. This would explain why televised music competitions, such as ‘The X Factor’ or ‘The Voice’, are such popular prime-time shows. These programmes attract incredibly broad audiences because singing and popular songs appeal to children, parents and grandparents alike. I would argue that no other form of entertainment can bring families together in this way.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that music is unique in its capacity to create shared experiences between people, irrespective of culture and age.","questionType":"Opinion","question" : "Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together.

"2":{"answer":"It is true that genetic engineering is a key area of modern scientific research, with broad implications for all human societies. While I accept that this field of technology may have its dangers, I believe that the benefits of genetic engineering outweigh the drawbacks.\r\n\r\nThe negative implications of genetic engineering are often discussed in terms of two key areas, which are food production and the cloning of humans. Genetically modified crops are already being grown, and people are concerned that they may damage whole ecosystems as foods become resistant to diseases and natural predators. But perhaps even more worrying is the possibility that humans could be modified or cloned. Some people imagine a world in which cloned humans are used to fight wars or to provide body part replacements. Although perhaps not a threat to life on earth, the implications of such practices would be unprecedented.r\n\r\nA more optimistic prediction, and one that I favour, is that humans will find ways to mitigate the risks and use genetic technologies in a responsible way. From the food production perspective, genetic engineering could be the solution to famine in developing countries, if, for instance, crops can be grown more reliably in harsh conditions. From a medical perspective, scientists may use genetic engineering to produce vaccines, to cure diseases, or to correct a genetic defect before a child is born. If properly regulated, even cloning can be done in a way that improves lives. For example, the cloning of individual organs, such as a heart or kidney, could be permitted for transplant purposes.r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that genetic engineering will have a positive impact on our lives, and that people's fears will be unwarranted.","band": 9,"questionType":"Opinion","question":"Genetic engineering is an important issue in society today.

"3":{"band":9,"questionType":"Opinion","question":"In many countries today, people in cities either live alone or in small family units, rather than in large, extended family groups. Is this a positive or negative trend?","answer":"It is true that cities are seeing a rise in smaller families and one-person households, while the extended family is becoming a rarity. In my opinion, this is a negative development.\r\n\r\nAs families become smaller, the traditional family support network is disappearing, and this can have a negative impact on children as they grow up. In a nuclear family or single-parent household, childcare becomes an expensive and stressful part of daily life. Without the help of grandparents or aunts and uncles, busy parents must rely on babysitters, nannies and after-school clubs to take care of younger children, while older children may be left alone after school and during holidays. The absence of adult family members can mean that friends, television and the Internet become the primary influences on children’s behaviour. It is no surprise that the decline of the extended family has been linked to a rise in psychological and behavioural problems amongst young people.\r\n\r\nThe trend towards people living alone is perhaps even more damaging because of the psychological effects of reduced human interaction. Individuals who live on their own have nobody to talk to in person, so they cannot share problems or discuss the highs and lows of daily life. They forgo the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of a large family, and are left to their own devices for extended periods of time. The lack of human contact in the home is necessarily replaced by passive distractions, such as television, video games, online chat rooms or Internet surfing. This type of existence is associated with boredom, loneliness, and feelings of isolation or even alienation, all of which are factors that are known to increase the risk of mental illness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that individuals thrive when they are part of larger family groups, and so it is worrying that many people are choosing to live alone or in such small family units."},
"4":{"band":8,"questionType":"Opinion","question":"Popular hobbies and interests change over time and are more a reflection of trends and fashions than an indication of what individuals really want to do in their spare time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Some leisure activities become fashionable for a short time and then disappear when a new trend comes along, whereas others seem to be perennially popular. I can therefore only partly agree with the assertion that hobbies reflect changing fashions rather than our true interests.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is true that many hobbies are simply passing trends. Children and teenagers, in particular, are attracted to whatever activity is currently popular among their peers. My 10-year-old niece, for example, seems to have a new interest every month, as she joins in with the latest craze that sweeps through her primary school. Over the last year or so, she has been obsessed with Rubik’s cubes, fidget spinners, squidgies and slime. In a similar way, there have been several different fitness trends for adults over recent years, from jogging to yoga to circuit training, and I doubt whether the majority of participants continued to enjoy those activities in the long term.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many people spend their free time doing popular activities that are far from trendy. One good example would be the game chess. Children and adults who enjoy playing chess are certainly not following a new fashion or wasting their time on something that they do not truly like. On the contrary, they are passionate about a game that has existed for hundreds of years, and they find it inherently fascinating and absorbing. I would say the same about many other hobbies, from reading to swimming."},
"5":{"band":7,"questionType":"Opinion","question":"Public museums and art galleries are not needed because people can see historical objects and works on their computers. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer": "It is certainly true that computers have become a vital tool for people to learn history and art. However, while computers are extremely useful towards seeing historical and artistic stuffs, I do not agree with the idea that museum and galleries could be scrapped because of modern computer technology.\r\n\r\nThere are several advantages to using computer in learning historical and artistic objects. Firstly, computers allow individuals to learn more knowledge regarding historical and artistic works easily and economically. This means that if people want to see mummification, they can have easily access to the internet rather than flying to Egypt. Secondly, some extremely valuable treasures may not be shown to public for security reasons. As a result, tourists may bee disappointed when they are not allowed to see their favorites stuffs and computers therefore are the only way for people to know about historical items. Finally, museum and galleries could impose people insecure feelins by using numerous of security cameras while computers do not.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite all the advantages that I said before, computers cannot replace museum and galleries and make them useless. Its is believed that museum and galleries collect a great deal of iconic treasures in many countries, and they are the best way to see historical and artistic works because of their reality and uniqueness. Touching computer do not provide people an authentic atmosphere as in real museum. Apart from this, computers sometimes have fake information which may lead people having wrong concepts.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that museum and galleries are useful and irreplaceable, though there are some benefits to using computers to see antique stuffs. It is much reasonable to use computer as a tool to support museum and galleries."}}
